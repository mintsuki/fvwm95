       FvwmTalk - the FVWM command line interface


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       FvwmTalk is spawned by fvwm, so no command line invocation
       will work.



</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The FvwmTalk allows the user to type fvwm commands into  a
       window, and have them executed immediately. These commands
       are usually specfified in the .fvwmrc file, or  are  bound
       to  menu/mouse items as specified in that file. This tools
       is  particularly  useful  for  testing  new  configuration
       ideas, or for implementing temporary changes to your envi-
       ronment.



</PRE>
<H2>COPYRIGHTS</H2><PRE>
       The FvwmTalk program, and the concept for interfacing this
       module  to  the  Window  Manager, are all original work by
       Robert Nation

</PRE>
<H2>INITIALIZATION</H2><PRE>
       So kill me, I can't remember what goes on.



</PRE>
<H2>INVOCATION</H2><PRE>
       FvwmTalk can be invoked  by  inserting  the  line  'Module
       FvwmTalk'  in  the  .fvwmrc  file. This can be placed on a
       line by itself, if FvwmTalk is to be spawned during fvwm's
       initialization,  or can be bound to a menu or mouse button
       or keystroke to invoke it later. Fvwm will  search  direc-
       tory  specified  in the ModulePath configuration option to
       attempt to locate FvwmTalk.

<H2>CONFIGURATION OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       I plead ignorance here. Read the code.
