       FvwmDebug - the FVWM module debugger


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       FvwmDebug  is  spawned by fvwm, so no command line invoca-
       tion will work.



</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The FvwmDebug captures the stream of module packets coming
       from fvwm, and displays them on stderr.



</PRE>
<H2>COPYRIGHTS</H2><PRE>
       The  FvwmDebug  program,  and  the concept for interfacing
       this module to the Window Manager, are all  original  work
       by Robert Nation

       Copyright 1994, Robert Nation. No guarantees or warranties
       or anything are provided or implied in any way whatsoever.
       Use  this program at your own risk. Permission to use this
       program for any purpose is given, as long as the copyright
       is kept intact.




</PRE>
<H2>INITIALIZATION</H2><PRE>
       During  initialization,  the  FvwmDebug requests that fvwm
       dump a complete window list into its pipe.  These  packets
       are terminated with and "end Send_WindowList" message.



</PRE>
<H2>INVOCATION</H2><PRE>
       FvwmDebug  can  be  invoked  by inserting the line 'Module
       FvwmDebug' in the .fvwmrc file. This can be  placed  on  a
       line  by  itself,  if  FvwmDebug  is  to be spawned during
       fvwm's initialization, or can be bound to a menu or  mouse
       button  or  keystroke to invoke it later. Fvwm will search
       directory specified in the ModulePath configuration option
       to attempt to locate FvwmDebug.



</PRE>
<H2>CONFIGURATION OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       There are no configuration options.
