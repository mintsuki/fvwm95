       FvwmSave - the FVWM desktop-layout saving module


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       FvwmSave is spawned by fvwm, so no command line invocation
       will work.



</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       When called, this module will attempt to save your current
       desktop  layout  into  a file called new.xinitrc. Ideally,
       this file will look just like .xinitrc,  but  in  reality,
       you  will  have to edit it to get a useable configuration,
       so be sure to keep a backup of your old .xinitrc.

       Your applications must supply certain hints to the X  win-
       dow  system.   Emacs,  for  example, does not, so FvwmSave
       can't get any information from it.

       Also, FvwmSave assumes that certain command  line  options
       are  globally  accepted  by applications, which may not be
       the case.

       this  module  to the Window Manager, are all original work

<H2>INITIALIZATION</H2><PRE>
       During initialization, <I>NoClutter</I> will eventually search  a
       configuration  file  which  describes  the  time-outs  and
       actions to take.  The configuration file is the same  file
       that fvwm used during initialization.

       If  the NoClutter executable is linked to another name, ie
       ln -s NoClutter OtherClutter, then another  module  called
       OtherClutter  can  be started, with a completely different
       configuration than NoClutter, simply by changing the  key-
       word   NoClutter  to OtherClutter. This way multiple clut-
       ter-reduction programs can be used.



</PRE>
<H2>INVOCATION</H2><PRE>
       NoClutter can be invoked by  inserting  the  line  'Module
       fvwm's  initialization, or can be bound to a menu or mouse
       button or keystroke to invoke it later. Fvwm  will  search
       directory specified in the ModulePath configuration option
       to attempt to locate NoClutter.



</PRE>
<H2>CONFIGURATION OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       NoClutter reads the same .fvwmrc file as fvwm  reads  when
       it  starts  up, and looks for lines similar to "*NoClutter
       3600 Iconify". The format of these  lines  is  "*NoClutter
       [time] [command]", where command is any fvwm built-in com-
       mand, and time is the time in seconds between when a  win-
       dow looses focus and when the command is executed. At most
       3 actions can be specified.
