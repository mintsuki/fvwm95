       FvwmCpp - the FVWM  Cpp pre-processor


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       FvwmCpp  is spawned by fvwm, so no command line invocation
       will work.



</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       When called, this module will attempt to have /usr/lib/cpp
       pre-process the file specified in its invocation, and then
       have fvwm read the resulting file.



</PRE>
<H2>INVOCATION</H2><PRE>
       FvwmCpp can be invoked by inserting the line 'FvwmCpp'  in
       the  .fvwmrc  file.  It  can also be called from a menu or
       mouse binding.  If the user wants his entire .fvwmrc  file
       pre-processed with FvwmCpp, then fvwm should be invoked as
       "fvwm -f /usr/lib/X11/fvwm/FvwmCpp

       Some options can be specified on the command line:

       -Cppopt
              Lets you pass an option to the cpp program.


       -Cppprog
              Instead  of  invoking  "/usr/lib/cpp",  fvwm   will
              invoke <I>name</I>.

       -debug Causes  the  temporary  file  create  by  Cpp to be
              retained. This file is usually called  "/tmp/fvwmr-
              cXXXXXX"




</PRE>
<H2>CONFIGURATION OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       FvwmCpp  defines  some values for use in the pre-processor
       file:


       TWM_TYPE
              Always set to "fvwm".

       SERVERHOST
              The name of the machine running the X Server.

       CLIENTHOST
              The name of the machine running fvwm.

       HOSTNAME
              The hostname of the machine running fvwm. Generally

       USER   The name of the person running fvwm.

       VERSION
              The X11 version.

       REVISION
              The X11 revision number.

       VENDOR The X server vendor.

       RELEASE
              The X server release number.

       WIDTH  The screen width in pixels.

       HEIGHT The screen height in pixels.

       X_RESOLUTION
              Some  distance/pixel measurement for the horizontal
              direction, I think.

       Y_RESOLUTION
              Some distance/pixel measurement  for  the  vertical
              direction, I think.

       PLANES Number of color planes for the X server display

       BITS_PER_RGB
              Number of bits in each rgb triplet.

       CLASS  The X11 visual class, ie PsuedoColor.

       COLOR  Yes  or  No,  Yes  if  the display class is neither
              StaticGrey or GreyScale.

       FVWM_VERSION
              The fvwm version number, ie 2.0

       OPTIONS
              Some combination of SHAPE, XPM, NO_SAVEUNDERS,  and
              Cpp, as defined in configure.h at compile time.

       FVWMDIR
              The directory where fvwm looks for .fvwmrc and mod-
              ules by default, as determined at compile time.

<H2>AUTHOR</H2><PRE>
       FvwmCpp is the result of a random bit mutation on  a  hard
       disk,  presumably  a  result of a  cosmic-ray or some such
       thing.
